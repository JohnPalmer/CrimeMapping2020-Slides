# Introduction {-}

This manual is intended to function as a companion to the _Crime Mapping and Spatial Analysis_ labs as well as a stand-along reference for working with QGIS, Stata, and R for mapping and analysis. Each chapter walks you through a particular task or set of tasks, usually with an exercise to serve as an example. These are organized according to the class lab sessions but can also be followed intependently or used as a reference.

## Accessing QGIS {-}

QGIS is free and open source software, which you can download from https://qgis.org. At the time of writing, version 3.4 is the most recent long-term stable release and this manual is based on that version. When installing QGIS, leaving all of the default options as they are should be fine for purposes of this manual. The Windows installation includes a number of different choices for running QGIS; you shoud simply select the normal desktop version. 

## Accessing Stata {-}

Stata is proprietary software, which cannot be freely downloaded if have not purchased a license. However, as a UPF student, you have free access to Stata on the UPF lab computers and through UPF's _MyApps_ platform. The latter requires an internet connection and has some limitations in terms of resources, but you can access it from outside UPF using your own computer and a web browser.

To access Stata through _MyApps_, open a web browser and go to https://myapps.upf.edu. Log in using your UPF user ID (uxxxxx) and the password you use for logging into UPF computers (i.e. your birthdate, written as DDMMYYYY). Remember that this is not necessarily the password you use for Campus Global; your browser may have that Campus Global password stored, in which case you will need to manually change it each time. On the login page, you will need to choose between using _vWorkspace Connector_ or simply through your web browser with HTML5. The first option allows you to access local files on your computer, but it can be slow and "buggy", particularly on Macs. To follow this approach, click the _Install_ button on the page you reach after logging in. The second option can be faster, but any files you want to use will need to be first uploaded through the UPF MyCloud. To follow this approach, click the _Continue_ button on the page after login, and then flip the _HTML5_ switch to the on position at the top right of your screen.

## Accessing R {-}

R is free and open source software, which you can download from https://cran.r-project.org/. You will normally want to install the latest release from that site, and to then install a good text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An excellent choice for the latter is the (free) Open Source Edition of RStudio, which you can download from https://www.rstudio.com. R and RStudio are also both available on the lab computers. This manual will assume that you are running RStudio.
