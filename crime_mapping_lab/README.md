This manual is intended to function as a companion to the _Crime Mapping and Spatial Analysis_ labs as well as a stand-along reference for working with QGIS, Stata, and R for mapping and analysis. Each chapter walks you through a particular task or set of tasks, usually with an exercise to serve as an example. These are organized according to the class lab sessions but can also be followed intependently or used as a reference.
