# Creating Vector Data From Raster Base

It will often be necessary to create vector data -- points, lines, or polygons -- by tracing features on an existing raster map. This recipe will walk you through that process.

## Adding a raster

Start a new project and add a raster layer. For this exercise, use a high resolution orthophoto, such as those available at <a href="http://www.icc.cat/appdownloads/index.html">http://www.icc.cat/appdownloads/index.html</a>. By saving the file in GeoTiff format you will ensure that it includes projection (CRS) information that QGIS can read automatically. Add the layer using <kbd>Layer  &rarr; Add Layer  &rarr; Add Raster Layer...</kbd> and then selecting the file (same for both versions 2.18 and 3.4 although the file selector looks different in each). If the file itself does not contain projection information, you will need to supply this.

## Creating a new vector layer.

Create a new vector layer using <kbd>Layer &rarr; Create Layer &rarr; New Shapefile Layer...</kbd> (same in both versions). In the window that pops up, you can choose to make this a layer of points, lines, or polygons (see <kbd>Type</kbd> row at the top in version 2018; see <kbd>Geometry Type</kbd> selector, third from top in version 3.4). You can also modify the character encoding (<kbd>File Encoding</kbd> selector in both versions 2.18 and 3.4), the Coordinate Reference System (selector just below the <kbd>File Encoding</kbd> selector in both versions), and the data fields that will be associated with this new layer. 

For this exercise, choose <kbd>Polygon</kbd> as the type, and add at least one new field in which you will store information associated with each feature that you draw. For this exercise, we will be using the layer to indicate the approximate number of people on each block surrounding a building, so create a <kbd>Whole Number</kbd> field and give it a name (e.g. N). Save the new layer as an SHP file in a directory where you will be able to find it again.                                                                                  
## Adding features

The new layer you have added should appear in the <kbd>Layers Panel</kbd>. Right click on this new layer and select <kbd>Toggle Editing</kbd> (same in both versions). You will now see a set of new buttons and available menu items. In version 2.18, now select the menu item <kbd>Edit &rarr; Add Feature</kbd>; in version 3.4 this is <kbd>Edit &rarr; Add Polygon Feature</kbd>. When you hover the mouse pointer over the map you will see that it now has the shape of a cross-hairs. Left click to add sequential points that define the polygon you want to add. When you have added the last point, right click the mouse and a dialog box will appear asking you to add the fields associated with this new feature. Remember that what you add will be limited by the field type you chose (and the ID field requires whole numbers by default). For this exercise, draw a rectangle over each of the sidewalks surrounding the building (so four separate features).
